## Leslie matrix example

Model population changes using the same example we did in lecture.

```{r}
insect_leslie <- matrix(c(0, 0, 600, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.08, 0), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

insect_leslie
```

```{r}
# Initial condition

insect_y0 <- c(12000, 700, 500)
```

```{r}
# Insect populations for year 1
insect_y1 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y0

insect_y1
```

```{r}
# Insect populations for year 2
insect_y2 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y1

insect_y2
```

```{r}
# Insect populations for year 3
insect_y3 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y2

insect_y3
```
